- Open your browser at `http://localhost:5713`

## Project Structure

- `/src/pages` holds page components
- `/src/ui` houses shared UI elements
- `/src/context` for global state: ##Handling dark and light mode##
- `/src/features`: contains modules for each major feature (authentication, bookings, cabins, check-in-out, dashboard, settings).
- `/src/hooks` contains global hooks
- `/src/services` conatins all supbase services
- `/src/data` holds all the demo data
- `/src/utils` contains utility functions

## Tools Used

- Supabase for backend
- React, React Router, and React Query for frontend
- React Hot Toast for notifications
- Styled Components for styling

## Supabase Services

- Authentication: Handles user signups, logins, and session management through Supabase Auth.
- Database: Manages and queries data in tables like bookings, cabins, and settings.
- Storage: Uploads and manages user files (e.g., avatars, cabin images).

## React Router

The project uses React Router for client-side routing:

- Different URL paths load corresponding pages (Dashboard, Bookings, Cabins, etc.).
- Protected routes are managed to ensure only authenticated users access certain areas.

### Routes and URLs

- /dashboard : Displays the main dashboard
- /bookings : Shows a list of bookings
- /bookings/:bookingId : Fetches details for a single booking
- /checkin/:bookingId : Form to check in a guest
- /cabins : Manages cabins
- /users : Manages user information
- /settings : Configures application settings
- /account : Shows the current userâ€™s account info
- /login : Public route for authentication

### Protected Routing

All routes except /login are wrapped in a ProtectedRoute component, ensuring only authenticated users can access them.
